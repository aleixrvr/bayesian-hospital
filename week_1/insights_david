##  Week 1 Results David

### Findings from week 1

- **Admissions table:**
  - Most admissions are emergencies.
  - The distribution of time stayed has fat tails. The median of the stay time is highest for urgent
  and emergency, and lowest for newborn.
  - Proportion of death is higher for urgent and emergency (around 12%), and
  lower for the others (less than 3%)
  - Diagnosys for newborn is newborn.
  - Most common diagnoses are pneumonia and sepsis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease.
  - Discharge hours are usually from 10 to 18 (working hours).
  - Admission hours follow a roughly uniform distribution for non-elecitve admissions, 
  and are usually from 8 to 10 in elective admissions, and some of them from 10 to 15.

- **Icustays table:**
  - First and last careunit are usually the same (93%).
  - MICU is the most common first care unit, and TSICU is the last.
  
- **Caregivers table:**
  - 232 types of caregivers. Only 103 types appear more than once in the table. 
  - Most of them Read Only, then Medical Doctors, Residents.

- **d_items table:**
  - Around 11k different items.
  - Most of them appear very rarely in chartevents (by sampling 5k rows, we only have 100 items),
 and 30 of them account for the 80% of the tasks.
 
- **chartevents table:**
  - On average, there are 5000 tasks per admission. However, the distributon of number of tasks
 per admission has fat tails.
  - Most events are done by RNs (nurses).
  - The most common events include: Ectopy Type, Code Status, Ectopy Frequency, Arterial BP Mean, CVP.

- **labevents table:**
  - Joins with d_labitems by item.
  - Valuenum is the value of the measurement and valueuom are the units.
  - Flags are either empty or abnormal.
  - (labitems) Fluid is mostly blood, and olso urine.
  - (labitems) Cathegories are mostly chemistry and hematology, and some blood gas.
  - (labitems) Labels are chemical compounds or elements.
  
- **services table:**
  - prev_service is mostly empty (due to new admissions, maybe).
  - curr_service is most commonly MED.

- **transfers table:**
  - Transfers includes admissions, discharges and transfers.
  - Admissions have empty prev_careunit, discharges have empty curr_careunit (makes sense),
  - Transfers are commonly between: empty and empty, then NICU and NICU, then MICU to empty.
  - Intime and outtime hours are typically from 10 to 20.
