# Platform

We have used BigQuery from Google Cloud Platform to manage and process MIMIC's data. Some links that may be useful

- MIMIC's documentation: https://mimic.physionet.org/
- MIMIC's databse schema https://mit-lcp.github.io/mimic-schema-spy/
- Code repository: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code
- Visualization tool: http://hdsl.uwaterloo.ca/visualization-tool/

# Uploading data to Big Query

The best way to upload data si following step by step the tutorial from MIMIC' github repository 
https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/master/buildmimic/bigquery.  

Call your BQ Dataset **MIMIC3\_V1\_4** so that the rest of the scripts are compatible.

# Connect to BigQuery via R

For this you can use the `BQ connection example.R` file. First time you use it, it asks you for your google authorization and saves a file in your disk to remember it. **Note**: If you use any type of code repository, be careful to ignore this file, otherwise you will upload your credentials to your repository. 


# Build Tables

In order to build the required tables for the modelling process and applications follow the steps outlined below: 

1. Run the `build-bq-tables/shifting_stability.R` script. This will create a table called ICUSTAYS_TRANS_COLLAPSED in BigQuery Dataset (MIMIC3_V1_4).
2. Execute the `build-bq-tables/join_depts.sql` query in BigQuery. This step (along with steps 3, 4 and 5) require you to set a destination table for the query results. Call your BQ table CHARTEVENTS_DEPTS.
3. Execute the `build-bq-tables/merge_categories.sql` query in BigQuery. Call your BQ table CHARTEVENTS_DEPTS_CATS.
4. Execute the `build-bq-tables/chart_time_collapsing.sql` query in BigQuery. Call your BQ table CHARTEVENTS_DEPTS_CATS_TS_COLLAPSED.
5. Run the `build-bq-tables/chart_time_collapsing_final.sql` query in BigQuery. Call your BQ table CHARTEVENTS_DEPTS_CATS_TS_COLLAPSED\_FINAL.


# Data Exploration App

For running this Shiny App, you just need to open and run the RStudio project (`app.Rproj`) in the folder `exploration-app`.

# Model Building

For building the models that will be later on used by the outflow-app, open the bayesian-hospital RStudio project in the main folder and then execute:

- `model-building/data/final-data-retrieval.R` to save summarized data locally 
- `model-building/build_model.R` to build and save the models in `model-building/model/`


# Outflow App

To run the application, one needs to open and run the RStudio project (`outflow_app.Rproj`) in the folder `outflow-app` (precise instructions are provided in `outflow-app/README.md`). The application illustrates the effect of a chosen resource policy on the intensive care units outflow and recommends the best unit on which to apply the resource policy selected (along with its economic impact)

The economic effect is simply the net outflow multiplied by â‚¬10 000. This can be easily modified in the `outflow-app/global.R` script (line 19).
